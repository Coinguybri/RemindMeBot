# RemindMeBot
A telegram bot to give you periodical reminders.

This bot will send you reminders! Simply tell it when you want to be reminded, and what of, and the bot will handle it for you! 
Use the /remindme command to set a new reminder.

### Example commands

`/remindme in ten minutes to take my pie out of the oven`

Bot response:

**New reminder added!**  
**Reminded at:** _11:54:53, 22-Aug-2017 UTC_  
**Reminder:** _take my pie out of the oven_


`/remindme tomorrow that I need to go grocery shopping`

Bot response:

**New reminder added!**  
**Reminded at:** _11:47:46, 23-Aug-2017 UTC_  
**Reminder:** _I need to go grocery shopping_  


The bot can remind you _to_ do something or _that_ you need to do something. It doesn't matter which one you use, so just type it however you like!
